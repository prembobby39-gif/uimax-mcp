One command — *"review my UI at localhost:3000"* — and it:

1. **Sees your app** — captures a real screenshot via Puppeteer
2. **Audits accessibility** — runs axe-core for WCAG 2.1 violations
3. **Runs Lighthouse** — real Google Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
4. **Measures performance** — captures Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS, TBT)
5. **Scans your code** — checks for 25+ anti-patterns across accessibility, design, and code quality
6. **Generates an expert review** — Claude acts as a senior frontend engineer with a baked-in review methodology
7. **Implements the fixes** — edits your actual code files, starting from critical issues down

**Free for all Claude Code users (Pro plan and above). No API keys. No extra costs. Just install and go.**

```bash
claude mcp add uimax -- npx -y uimax-mcp
```

## The Problem

You're building a frontend. You want expert-level feedback on your UI — visual design, accessibility, performance, code quality. Normally you'd need to:

1. Take screenshots manually
2. Run Lighthouse / axe separately
3. Review your own code with fresh eyes
4. Compile all findings into a coherent review
5. Then figure out the fixes

**That's 5 steps too many.**

## Quick Start

### Install as MCP Server (for Claude Code)

```bash
# Add to Claude Code — that's it, no API keys needed
claude mcp add uimax -- npx -y uimax-mcp
```

That's it. Now in any Claude Code conversation:

```
You: Review the UI at http://localhost:3000, source code is in ./src

Claude Code calls review_ui ->
  1. Captures screenshot of your running app
  2. Runs axe-core accessibility audit
  3. Runs Google Lighthouse (Performance, A11y, Best Practices, SEO)
  4. Measures Core Web Vitals
  5. Scans source code for 25+ anti-patterns
  6. Returns screenshot + all data + expert review methodology
  7. Claude Code generates expert review (using YOUR Pro plan -- $0 extra)
  8. Claude Code implements every fix automatically
```

### Install Globally

```bash
npm install -g uimax-mcp
```

---

## Tools

The MCP server exposes **35 tools** that Claude uses automatically:

### `review_ui` -- Full Automated Pipeline

This is the main tool. One call does **everything**:
1. Captures screenshot of your running app
2. Runs accessibility audit (axe-core WCAG 2.1)
3. Runs Google Lighthouse (scores + key audits)
4. Measures Core Web Vitals via Performance API
5. Scans your source code for anti-patterns
6. Returns ALL data + expert frontend review methodology to Claude Code
7. Claude Code generates the expert review and implements fixes

```
Input:  URL + code directory
Output: Screenshot + Lighthouse scores + audit data + expert methodology
        -> Claude Code generates review + implements every fix
```

> **100% free for Pro plan users.** The MCP handles data collection. Claude Code (your existing subscription) handles the expert review and implementation. No API keys. No extra charges.

### `quick_review`
Fast design-only review. Captures a screenshot and returns it with a focused design methodology. No code analysis, no performance audit. Good for rapid iteration.

### `lighthouse_audit`
Runs a full **Google Lighthouse** audit and returns real scores for:
- **Performance** (0-100)
- **Accessibility** (0-100)
- **Best Practices** (0-100)
- **SEO** (0-100)

Plus detailed findings for failing audits with fix instructions. This is the real Lighthouse — the same tool Chrome DevTools uses.

### `compare_screenshots`
**Before/after visual comparison with pixel-level diffing.** Give it two URLs — captures both, runs `pixelmatch` to compute exact pixel differences, and generates a red-highlighted diff image showing what changed. Perfect for:
- Verifying UI fixes actually changed what you expected
- Comparing staging vs production
- Visual regression checking

```
Input:  URL A ("before") + URL B ("after")
Output: Both screenshots + diff image + pixel difference % + pixels changed + dimensions
```

### `export_report`
Generates a **standalone HTML report** with everything embedded — screenshot, accessibility violations, Lighthouse scores, performance metrics, code findings. Dark themed, zero external dependencies. Share it with your team, attach it to a PR, or email it to a client.

```
Input:  URL + code directory + output path (optional)
Output: Self-contained HTML file at the specified path
```

### `screenshot`
Captures a high-resolution PNG screenshot of any URL. Claude can see the image directly and analyze visual design, layout, spacing, typography, and color usage.

### `responsive_screenshots`
Captures screenshots at **mobile (375px)**, **tablet (768px)**, and **desktop (1440px)** viewports. Perfect for reviewing responsive design.

### `check_dark_mode`
Detects whether your app supports dark mode. Captures two screenshots — light mode and dark mode (emulated via `prefers-color-scheme: dark`) — and compares them. Returns both screenshots + a difference percentage.

### `accessibility_audit`
Injects [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) into the page and runs a WCAG 2.1 Level A & AA audit. Returns violations grouped by severity with fix instructions.

### `performance_audit`
Measures Core Web Vitals using the browser's Performance API:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Total Blocking Time (TBT)
- DOM node count, resource count, JS heap size

### `crawl_and_review`
**Multi-page audit from a single URL.** Give it one URL and it discovers all internal links, then audits up to 10 pages — each getting a screenshot, axe-core accessibility audit, and Core Web Vitals measurement. Perfect for reviewing an entire site without running page-by-page.

```
Input:  Starting URL + maxPages (optional, default 5) + code directory (optional)
Output: Per-page screenshots + accessibility issues + performance metrics + overall summary
```

### `save_baseline`
Save the current audit state for a URL as a baseline snapshot. Runs accessibility, performance, and Lighthouse audits, then appends the results to `.uimax-history.json` in your project directory. Use this before making changes so you can compare later.

```
Input:  URL + optional code directory
Output: Baseline entry saved to .uimax-history.json
```

### `compare_to_baseline`
Compare the current audit state of a URL against its most recent saved baseline. Runs fresh audits, loads the previous baseline, and shows what improved and what regressed. Automatically saves the new results as the latest baseline.

```
Input:  URL + optional code directory
Output: Improvements, regressions, and unchanged metrics
```

### `check_budgets`
Check if the current site meets performance budgets defined in `.uimaxrc.json`. Runs fresh audits and compares against budget thresholds for Lighthouse scores, Web Vitals, accessibility violations, and code issues. Returns pass/fail with details of any exceeded budgets.

```
Input:  URL + optional code directory (for .uimaxrc.json)
Output: Pass/fail status + details of any budget violations
```

### `analyze_code`
Scans frontend source files for **25+ categories** of issues. Uses **AST-based analysis** (TypeScript compiler API) for `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx` files — catches bugs that regex misses, with zero false positives on string literals. Falls back to regex for other file types and rules without AST implementations. Supports custom configuration via `.uimaxrc.json` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

**AST-powered rules** (zero false positives):
| Rule | What AST catches that regex misses |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| `react-hooks-conditional` | Hooks inside nested if/for/while/ternary — proper scope traversal |
| `missing-key-prop` | `.map()` callbacks returning JSX without `key` — handles arrow/block bodies |
| `empty-catch` | Empty catch blocks — not fooled by comments |
| `any-type` | `any` in type positions only — ignores "any" in strings/comments |
| `direct-dom-access` | `document.querySelector` etc. — proper call expression matching |
| `console-log` | `console.log/warn/error` — not fooled by variable names containing "console" |
| `inline-style` | JSX `style={}` attributes — proper attribute detection |

### Deep Lighthouse Tools

Five dedicated tools for granular performance analysis — goes deeper than a single Lighthouse score.

### `pwa_audit`
Check Progressive Web App readiness: installable, service worker, HTTPS, manifest, offline capability.

### `security_audit`
Security analysis: HTTPS usage, Content Security Policy, mixed content, vulnerable JavaScript libraries, external links without `noopener`.

### `unused_code`
Find unused JavaScript and CSS with exact byte savings per resource. Know exactly what to tree-shake.

### `lcp_optimization`
Deep analysis of your Largest Contentful Paint: what the LCP element is, resource load time, render delay, TTFB, with specific optimization suggestions.

### `resource_analysis`
Full resource breakdown by type (JS, CSS, images, fonts), total transfer size, request count, top 10 largest resources, and render-blocking resources.

### Browser Interaction Tools

Seven tools for interacting with your running app — click buttons, fill forms, navigate, and verify the results visually.

### `navigate`
Navigate to a URL, wait for network idle. Returns page info + screenshot.

### `click`
Click an element by CSS selector. Returns a screenshot after the click so Claude can verify the result.

### `type_text`
Type text into an input field. Options: `clearFirst` to clear existing value, `pressEnter` to submit. Returns screenshot after.

### `select_option`
Select a dropdown option by value. Returns screenshot after.

### `scroll`
Scroll the page by pixel amount (up/down) or to a specific element via CSS selector. Returns screenshot after.

### `wait_for`
Wait for an element to appear in the DOM. Returns element tag name and text content.

### `get_element`
Get detailed info about a DOM element: attributes, bounding box, computed styles (color, font, background), visibility.

### Debugging Tools

Three tools for capturing what's happening under the hood during page load.

### `capture_console`
Capture all console messages (log, warn, error, info, debug) and uncaught exceptions during page load. Returns entries with timestamps and source locations.

### `capture_network`
Capture all network requests with status codes, sizes, timing, and resource types. Returns per-request details + summary grouped by type (JS, CSS, images, etc.).

### `capture_errors`
Capture JavaScript exceptions, unhandled promise rejections, and failed resource loads (broken images, missing scripts/stylesheets).

### AI-Powered Review

### `semantic_compare`
**AI-powered visual comparison.** Captures before/after screenshots, runs pixel-level diff, and returns a structured methodology prompt for Claude to semantically evaluate whether UI changes match the intended design request. Goes beyond pixel diffing to understand *intent*.

```
Input:  URL before + URL after + description of intended change
Output: Both screenshots + diff image + pixel diff % + semantic methodology for Claude
```

## Configuration

Create a `.uimaxrc.json` in your project root to customize code analysis:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "console-log": "off",
    "magic-number": "off",
    "hardcoded-color": "warn",
    "inline-style": "error"
  },
  "severity": {
    "todo-fixme": "high"
  },
  "ignore": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist",
    "*.test.*",
    "*.spec.*"
  ]
}
```

- **`rules`** — Set any rule to `"off"`, `"warn"`, or `"error"`
- **`severity`** — Override severity: `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"critical"`
- **`ignore`** — Additional glob patterns to exclude from analysis
- **`budgets`** — Performance budgets for the `check_budgets` tool (see below)

### Performance Budgets

Add a `budgets` key to `.uimaxrc.json` to define thresholds:

```json
{
  "budgets": {
    "lighthouse": {
      "performance": 90,
      "accessibility": 95,
      "bestPractices": 90,
      "seo": 90
    },
    "webVitals": {
      "fcp": 1800,
      "lcp": 2500,
      "cls": 0.1,
      "tbt": 300
    },
    "maxAccessibilityViolations": 0,
    "maxCodeIssues": 10
  }
}
```

Run `check_budgets` to verify your site meets these thresholds.

UIMax searches for `.uimaxrc.json` in the target directory and up to 3 parent directories, so it works in monorepos.
