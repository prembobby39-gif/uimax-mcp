One command — *"review my UI at localhost:3000"* — and it:

1. **Sees your app** — captures a real screenshot via Puppeteer
2. **Audits accessibility** — runs axe-core for WCAG 2.1 violations
3. **Runs Lighthouse** — real Google Lighthouse scores (Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO)
4. **Measures performance** — captures Core Web Vitals (FCP, LCP, CLS, TBT)
5. **Audits SEO** — 18 checks: meta tags, Open Graph, Twitter cards, structured data, heading hierarchy, canonical URLs
6. **Scans your code** — AST-based analysis for 25+ anti-patterns across accessibility, design, and code quality
7. **Grades everything** — per-section Report Card with letter grades (A+ through F) for Accessibility, Performance, Best Practices, SEO, and Code Quality
8. **Generates an expert review** — Claude acts as a senior frontend engineer with a baked-in review methodology
9. **Implements the fixes** — edits your actual code files, starting from critical issues down
10. **Tracks everything** — auto-saves review history so you can see progress over time

**Works on any URL** — localhost, staging, production. Any site your machine can reach.

**Free for all Claude Code users (Pro plan and above). No API keys. No extra costs. Just install and go.**

```bash
claude mcp add uimax -- npx -y uimax-mcp
```

---

## Quick Start

### Install as MCP Server (for Claude Code)

```bash
# Add to Claude Code — that's it, no API keys needed
claude mcp add uimax -- npx -y uimax-mcp
```

That's it. Now in any Claude Code conversation:

```
You: Review the UI at http://localhost:3000, source code is in ./src

Claude Code calls review_ui ->
  1. Captures screenshot of your running app
  2. Runs axe-core accessibility audit
  3. Runs Google Lighthouse (Performance, A11y, Best Practices, SEO)
  4. Measures Core Web Vitals
  5. Runs dedicated SEO audit (18 checks)
  6. Scans source code with AST-based analysis
  7. Generates per-section Report Card (A+ through F letter grades)
  8. Returns screenshot + all data + expert review methodology
  9. Claude Code generates expert review (using YOUR Pro plan -- $0 extra)
  10. Claude Code implements every fix automatically
  11. Review saved to .uimax-reviews.json for tracking
```

### Install Globally

```bash
npm install -g uimax-mcp
```

## Tools (37)

### Review Pipeline

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `review_ui` | **The main tool.** Full automated pipeline: screenshot + Lighthouse + axe-core + performance + SEO + code analysis + Report Card (A+-F letter grades) + expert review methodology. Auto-saves to review history. |
| `verify_fixes` | **New in v0.9.0.** Re-run the full audit after applying fixes. Compares against the previous review and shows a before/after Report Card with grade transitions, resolved issue count, and verdict (improved/regressed/mixed). Closes the review-fix-verify loop. |
| `compare_sites` | **New in v0.9.0.** Competitive benchmarking — audit two URLs side-by-side. Returns screenshots of both sites plus a comparison Report Card with grades for Accessibility, Performance, SEO, and weighted Overall score. |
| `quick_review` | Fast design-only review. Screenshot + focused design methodology. No code analysis or performance audit. |
| `export_report` | Generate a standalone HTML report with everything embedded. Now includes Report Card grade cards and SEO section. Dark themed, zero dependencies. Share with your team. |

### Screenshots & Visual

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|

### Review History

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `get_review_history` | View past UIMax reviews for this project. Filter by URL, limit count. Now includes letter grades alongside scores. |
| `get_review_stats` | Aggregate statistics: total reviews, score trends, most common issues, most problematic files. Includes Code Quality grades. |
| `review_diff` | Compare two specific reviews — new issues, resolved issues, score changes with letter grade transitions. |

> **Every review is auto-saved.** When you run `review_ui`, the results are automatically persisted to `.uimax-reviews.json`. No manual save needed — just ask "show me my review history" anytime.

---

## Report Card (A+ through F)

Every `review_ui` run now generates a **per-section Report Card** with letter grades on a 13-tier scale:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    REPORT CARD                       │
├──────────────────┬──────────┬───────┬───────────────┤
│ Section          │ Score    │ Grade │ Rating        │
├──────────────────┼──────────┼───────┼───────────────┤
│ Accessibility    │ 95       │ A     │ Excellent     │
│ Performance      │ 72       │ C-    │ Below Average │
│ Best Practices   │ 88       │ B+    │ Very Good     │
│ SEO              │ 61       │ D-    │ Very Weak     │
│ Code Quality     │ 83       │ B     │ Good          │
└──────────────────┴──────────┴───────┴───────────────┘
```

Grades appear in:
- **`review_ui` output** — Report Card table at the top of every review
- **`export_report` HTML** — color-coded grade cards (green A -> red F)
- **`compare_to_baseline`** — grade transitions showing improvement (e.g., `D -> B+ (+22)`)
- **`get_review_history` / `get_review_stats` / `review_diff`** — grades alongside numeric scores for quick scanning

The grading scale: `A+` (97+) > `A` (93+) > `A-` (90+) > `B+` (87+) > `B` (83+) > `B-` (80+) > `C+` (77+) > `C` (73+) > `C-` (70+) > `D+` (67+) > `D` (63+) > `D-` (60+) > `F` (<60)

## AST-Powered Code Analysis

The `analyze_code` tool uses the **TypeScript compiler API** for `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx` files — catching bugs that regex misses with zero false positives.

| Rule | What AST catches that regex misses |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| `react-hooks-conditional` | Hooks inside nested if/for/while/ternary — proper scope traversal |
| `missing-key-prop` | `.map()` callbacks returning JSX without `key` — handles arrow/block bodies |
| `empty-catch` | Empty catch blocks — not fooled by comments |
| `any-type` | `any` in type positions only — ignores "any" in strings/comments |
| `direct-dom-access` | `document.querySelector` etc. — proper call expression matching |
| `console-log` | `console.log/warn/error` — not fooled by variable names containing "console" |
| `inline-style` | JSX `style={}` attributes — proper attribute detection |

Falls back to regex for file types that can't be AST-parsed and for rules without AST implementations (hardcoded colors, z-index, font sizes, etc.).

---

## Configuration

Create a `.uimaxrc.json` in your project root to customize code analysis and performance budgets:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "console-log": "off",
    "magic-number": "off",
    "hardcoded-color": "warn",
    "inline-style": "error"
  },
  "severity": {
    "todo-fixme": "high"
  },
  "ignore": [
    "node_modules",
    "dist",
    "*.test.*",
    "*.spec.*"
  ],
  "budgets": {
    "lighthouse": {
      "performance": 90,
      "accessibility": 95,
      "bestPractices": 90,
      "seo": 90
    },
    "webVitals": {
      "fcp": 1800,
      "lcp": 2500,
      "cls": 0.1,
      "tbt": 300
    },
    "maxAccessibilityViolations": 0,
    "maxCodeIssues": 10
  }
}
```

- **`rules`** — Set any rule to `"off"`, `"warn"`, or `"error"`
- **`severity`** — Override severity: `"low"`, `"medium"`, `"high"`, `"critical"`
- **`ignore`** — Additional glob patterns to exclude from analysis
- **`budgets`** — Performance thresholds enforced by the `check_budgets` tool

UIMax searches for `.uimaxrc.json` in the target directory and up to 3 parent directories, so it works in monorepos.

## CI / GitHub Action

UIMax ships with a reusable GitHub Action that runs audits on every PR and posts a Report Card comment.

### Quick Setup

Copy the example workflow to your project:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/uimax-ci.yml
name: UIMax Review
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  uimax-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"

      # Build and start your app
      - run: npm ci && npm run build
      - run: npm start &
